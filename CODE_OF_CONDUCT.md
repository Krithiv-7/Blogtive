We’re building a welcoming, respectful, and productive community for everyone who contributes to the project.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, inclusive, and positive environment for all participants regardless of age, ability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We want our community to reflect the same principles as our product: collaborative, empowering, and respectful of all roles and contributions — from members who only report bugs to maintainers who merge PRs.

We believe good software comes from good people working well together.
